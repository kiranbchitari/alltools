QR codes are everywhere now. Menus at restaurants. Product packaging. Business cards. Event tickets. They went from "that weird square thing" to something everyone uses.

If you need to make one, here's what actually matters.

## What QR Codes Are Good For

The whole point is getting people from the physical world to the digital world. Scan with your phone, open something instantly.

**URLs** are the most common use. Print the QR code on a flyer, and people can visit your website without typing anything.

**WiFi login** is incredibly useful. Instead of telling guests "the password is Xq7#mK9!pL", they just scan and connect.

**Contact info** (vCard) lets people add your details to their phone with one scan. Way better than swapping paper cards.

**Plain text** works too, for short messages or codes people need to copy.

## Making a QR Code That Actually Works

**Keep the content short**

More data = more complexity = harder to scan. A short URL like `example.com/menu` is way better than a 200-character tracking link.

If you have a long URL, use a URL shortener first.

**Size matters**

The code needs to be big enough to scan. For print materials:
- Business cards: at least 0.8 × 0.8 inches
- Posters: at least 1 × 1 inch per foot of viewing distance
- Billboards: you'll need an actual designer

**Contrast is everything**

Black on white works best. Dark blue on white? Fine. Light gray on slightly lighter gray? Nobody's scanning that.

Don't invert it either. Dark modules on light background. That's how scanners expect it.

**Leave breathing room**

The white space around the code (called the "quiet zone") helps scanners find the edges. Don't crop it too tight or add a busy background right up against it.

## Mistakes That Break QR Codes

**Linking to a page that doesn't exist.** Test your code before printing 10,000 flyers.

**Using a URL that might change.** If you're printing physical materials, make sure that URL will work for years. Or use a redirect you control.

**Making it too small.** I've seen QR codes on billboards that were unreadable because they were tiny.

**Printing on shiny material.** Glossy surfaces reflect light and confuse cameras. Matte finishes work better.

**Over-customizing.** Yes, you can add logos and colors. But every modification makes the code harder to scan. Those heavily stylized codes with gradients and patterns? Half of them don't work.

## Static vs Dynamic QR Codes

**Static codes** contain the actual data. The URL is baked in. Simple and free.

**Dynamic codes** point to a redirect service. You can change where they go later. Useful for tracking or if you might need to update the destination.

Most people just need static codes. Dynamic is overkill unless you're running marketing campaigns.

## Creating Your QR Code

Here's the simple process:

1. Decide what you're linking to (URL, text, WiFi, contact)
2. Paste or enter the content
3. Download as PNG (PNG works for both web and print)
4. Test it with your phone before using it anywhere

Our [QR Code Generator](/tools/qr-code-generator) creates codes right in your browser. No account, no watermarks, no email required. Just enter your content and download.

## Pro Tips

**Use UTM parameters** for marketing URLs so you can track how many scans came from each placement.

**Print a test first.** Before a big print run, make one copy and scan it on multiple phones.

**Add a call to action.** Don't just slap a code on something. Tell people what happens when they scan. "Scan for menu" or "Scan to connect to WiFi."

**Consider placement.** Put codes at eye level. Don't make people crouch or reach up. And make sure there's enough light for the camera to work.
