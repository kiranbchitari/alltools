# Create Custom QR Codes for Free

QR Codes are everywhere. From restaurant menus to Wi-Fi logins, they bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

But most "free" QR code generators are traps. They let you make a code, but then:
*   They expire after 14 days.
*   They show ads when scanned.
*   They require a credit card to download the high-res version.

**FormatMint is different.** Our QR Code Generator is truly free, forever.

## What You Can Create

Our tool isn't just for website links. You can generate codes for:

*   **URLs:** Send users to your landing page or portfolio.
*   **Wi-Fi:** Let guests join your network without typing a password.
*   **Text:** Share a secret message or coupon code.
*   **Email/SMS:** Pre-fill a message to make contacting you easy.

## Customize Your Brand

A black-and-white square is boring. Make your QR code stand out:

1.  **Colors:** Match your brand's palette.
2.  **Logos:** Upload your icon to the center of the code.
3.  **Style:** Adjust the dot patterns and corner markers.

## Best Practices for QR Codes

*   **Contrast is King:** Ensure there's enough contrast between the foreground and background. Dark on light is safest.
*   **Size Matters:** If you're printing it, make sure it's at least 1x1 inch (2.5x2.5 cm).
*   **Test It:** Always scan your code with multiple phones before printing 1,000 flyers!

## Why Use FormatMint?

*   **No Expiration:** Your codes are static and will work forever.
*   **High Quality:** Download in PNG or SVG for crisp printing at any size.
*   **Privacy:** All generation happens in your browser. We don't track your scans.
