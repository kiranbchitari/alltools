You're in New York trying to schedule a call with someone in Tokyo. Your brain goes: "Okay, they're 14 hours ahead... or is it 13? And wait, is it their tomorrow or still today?"

Welcome to the nightmare of remote work.

## The Math Is Never Simple

Here's why timezone scheduling breaks people's brains:

**Daylight saving time.** The US shifts clocks. Europe shifts clocks. But on different days. So for a few weeks each year, the time difference changes.

**Half-hour offsets.** India is UTC+5:30. Not 5, not 6. Five and a half. Nepal is +5:45. Fun.

**Date line confusion.** Schedule something for "Tuesday" and half your team shows up on Wednesday.

**"Middle of the night" isn't obvious.** 9 AM in San Francisco is midnight in London. Easy to forget.

## Finding Overlapping Working Hours

The real challenge isn't just converting times. It's finding hours that work for everyone.

Let's say you have team members in:
- New York (EST)
- London (GMT)
- India (IST)
- Tokyo (JST)

Here's the painful reality:

| Time in NYC | London | India | Tokyo |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|
| 6 AM | 11 AM ✓ | 4:30 PM ✓ | 8 PM ✗ |
| 7 AM | 12 PM ✓ | 5:30 PM ✓ | 9 PM ✗ |
| 8 AM | 1 PM ✓ | 6:30 PM ✓ | 10 PM ✗ |

Notice how there's almost no time that's "working hours" for everyone? That's just reality with globally distributed teams.

## The Best Approach

**Accept that someone gets the bad time slots.** Rotate who takes inconvenient calls so the same person isn't always waking up early or staying late.

**Record important meetings.** If key people can't make it live, at least they can watch later.

**Use async by default.** Most things don't need a live meeting. Document decisions, use written updates, save synchronous time for what truly requires it.

**When you do meet, make it count.** Have an agenda. Start on time. End on time.

## Quick Mental Math Tips

Here are some time zone relationships worth memorizing:

**US to Europe:**
- East Coast to London: +5 hours (summer) or +5 hours (winter)
- West Coast to London: +8 hours

**US to Asia:**
- East Coast to India: +10.5 hours
- East Coast to Tokyo: +14 hours
- West Coast to Tokyo: +17 hours

**The ATI trick:** Asia is Tomorrow, In the future. If it's Monday evening in the US, it's probably Tuesday already in Asia.

## Handling DST Transitions

The worst weeks are:
- **Mid-March:** US springs forward, Europe doesn't (yet)
- **Late March:** Europe springs forward
- **Early November:** US falls back, Europe already did

During these transitions, double-check everything. Your usual patterns are off.

## Tools That Actually Help

Instead of doing mental math, just use a visual tool that shows multiple clocks at once.

I built a [World Clock](/tools/world-clock) that does exactly this:
- Add clocks for any timezone you need
- See who's in working hours at a glance
- Find overlapping times instantly
- Plan meetings with timezone conversion

It shows day and night for each location, highlights business hours, and even helps you find the best time slots when everyone's awake.

## Practical Tips

**Always specify the timezone.** "Let's meet at 3 PM" means nothing. "Let's meet at 3 PM EST / 8 PM GMT" is clear.

**Use UTC for group communications.** Especially in documentation. It's neutral territory.

**Put meeting times in the calendar invite, not just an email.** Calendar apps handle timezone conversion automatically.

**Double-check before confirming.** Especially for important meetings.

Remote work is fantastic, but timezone coordination is its biggest pain point. A little preparation goes a long way.
